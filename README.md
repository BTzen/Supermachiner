# Supermachiner

1. To minimize commit conflicts, work should be isolated from the master branch through the use of seperate branches.  The repo's been initialized with 2 seperate branches - alpha and beta - for this purposes.  These branches can be deleted and new branches created if necessary; they were made just to provide some other branches to work on new features in.

2. use of PHP requires a LAMP stack such as XAMPP.  In order for the PHP files to have an effect XAMPP must be running MySQL and the PHP files must be placed in the htdocs folder within XAMPP's installation folder.  The address of the file must be preceeded with localhost or it's equivalent loopback address.
