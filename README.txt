The application is a website which has been tested to run on Google Chrome version 49.0.2623.87 (Official Build) m (32-bit).  The website can be launched by opening "default.php" with a web browser. As previously mentioned, the site was developed and tested using Google Chrome and the experience provided using other browsers - or an older version of Chrome - may differ from that of the author.  PHP code isn't needed with the current version so it may be run without the use of a LAMP package or its alternatives.

Clicking on the image for a piece of media in the carousel will move the user to a different page for listening.  The default page may be returned to at any point by clicking the logo in the top left corner or by pressing the back key on your web browser.
